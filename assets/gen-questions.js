    question: "Which are the best treks to do in September, October?",
    answer: `<p>This season is known for crystal clear skies, colours of Autumn and lower crowds. The air in the mountains becomes crisp and squeaky clear, making Autumn the best time for mountain views. Big mountain views are at their best. Autumn is for the colours of leaves, grass and the skies. The forests are colourful, teeming with yellow and red foliage.

    question: "What are some easy treks for beginners?",
    answer: `<p>It’s wonderful that you’re planning to start trekking in the Himalayas. You’d be happy to know that around 70% of our trekkers are beginners and always get hooked to trekking after their first trek!</p><p>Having said that, you must choose your trek wisely — something that is not too difficult, yet will allow you to experience the grand settings of the Himalayas.</p><p>From a decade of experience, these are the treks we find best suited for beginners:</p><ul><li><a href="https://indiahikes.com/dayara-bugyal-trek/">Dayara Bugyal</a></li><li><a href="https://indiahikes.com/deoriatal-chandrashila-trek/">Deoriatal-Chandrashila</a></li><li><a href="https://indiahikes.com/brahmatal-trek/">Brahmatal</a></li><li><a href="https://indiahikes.com/kedarkantha-trek/">Kedarkantha</a></li><li><a href="https://indiahikes.com/kuari-pass/">Kuari Pass</a></li><li><a href="https://indiahikes.com/ali-bedni-bugyal-trek">Ali Bedni Bugyal</a></li></ul><p>Even though these treks are considered good for beginners, they need at least 30-45 days of preparation on your part. Ensure you go for the trek only after physically preparing for it.</p>`,

    question:
      "Is it true that I can repeat a trek with TrekWorld, without paying for it?",
    answer: `<p>Yes, we do have a “Repeat my trek” policy, and trekkers love it. This is because there are some thoughts and ideologies that we hold close to our hearts.</p><p><strong>1. As trekkers, there are times when we have to let go of a trek midway</strong>. Sometimes we fall ill or get hit by AMS or at times simply fatigue pulls us down. At other times bad weather plays spoilsport, or the trail is blocked. Your Trek Leader may send you down due to a safety or health issue.<br><br>At Indiahikes we feel terrible when such an event happens.</p><p>Should such a situation occur that you have to drop out from this trek, we want you to know that we feel as bad as you do. You can always come back another time and finish your adventure. For this, you do not have to pay Indiahikes any money.</p><p><strong>2. On the other hand, there are times when you fall in love with a trek</strong>. So much so that you want to do it again, perhaps see it in another season. If you ever desire to do a trek again, please do so. You don’t have to pay Indiahikes any money for repeating this trek. Just inform your Experience Coordinator who will guide you through a special internal process.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Our only request:</strong>&nbsp;Just register for your trek in advance – you know how it is with our groups – they get booked in advance.</p><p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>The Indiahikes “Repeat My Trek” policy does not apply to our international treks.</p>`,

So we have a range of high-quality gear available for rent at very small costs.&nbsp;</p><p>Take a look at them here –&nbsp;<a href="https://store.indiahikes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://store.indiahikes.com/</a></p><p>Your rental gear will be given to you at the base camp on the day you arrive.<br><br>In case you have rented a trekking backpack, you may use the cloakroom facility to keep your extra luggage.&nbsp;We want you to travel as light as possible from your home.&nbsp;</p><p>Renting of items close 3 days before the start of the trek.</p>`,

    question: "Can I join your treks as a solo trekker?",
    answer: `<p>Yes, absolutely. Many solo trekkers join our teams and have wonderful experiences. They end up meeting like-minded people on the trek and don't feel like they have come along on the trek anymore.</p><p>Our pre-trek experienced team ensures that you know your entire team well much <em>before</em> you actually head out on the trek.</p><p>Additionally, we have several women trekkers who join us solo as well because of the safety they get with the Indiahikes team. You're welcome to join us as a solo trekker too.</p>`,
