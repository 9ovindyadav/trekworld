  description:"<h1><strong>The Complete Guide To Neelkanth Mahadev Lake Trek<br></strong></h1><p>The Neelkanth Mahadev Lake trek is a hidden gem located deep in the interiors of magnificent Lahaul. The emerald-green alpine lake is believed to be the abode of Lord Shiva.</p><p>Legend has it that this is the spot where Lord Neelkanth underwent Tapasya - an austere, deep meditation to control one’s mind, speech, thoughts, and bodily desires.&nbsp;</p><p>Prepare for a trek that has it all – breathtaking valley views, mountain panoramas, and a stunning high-altitude lake. Experience exhilarating water crossings en route – at least five and counting! The contrasting landscapes of Kullu and Lahaul provide the perfect backdrop for this adventure.</p><h4>How we explored and documented this trek</h4><p>When the Atal Tunnel opened in 2020, it suddenly made the Lahaul region accessible to trekkers. At a distance of just 4 hours from Manali,&nbsp; Lahaul was an untouched destination waiting to be explored.</p><p>Intent on finding hidden trails, we sent out teams to explore Lahaul. We first documented and opened a gem of a trek in Miyar Valley. It was followed by the striking blue Ghepan Lake.</p><p>In July 2022, the team explored the relatively uncharted terrain leading up to Neelkanth Mahadev Lake. Heavy rains made the trek difficult to navigate, and the team was unable to complete the trek. A second exploration team went again in September 2022 and successfully completed the trek.</p><h4><strong>➤Table Of Contents</strong></h4><p>To navigate through the documentation easily, use this section of the Table of Contents.

  description:`<h2><strong>The Complete Guide to Serolsar Lake Trek</strong></h2><p>Serolsar Lake is in Tirthan Valley of Himachal Pradesh, located 75 km away from Kullu. The lake is situated at an altitude of 10,170 ft. To access the lake, you’ve to trek for 5 km. The trek starts from Jalori Pass, the highest altitude point that connects Kullu valley and Shimla Valley.</p><p>The lake is guarded by thick tall pine trees on all sides. Next to the lake is Budhi Nagin temple. Serolsar Lake is surrounded by a narrow track and a fence around it. The Serolsar Lake wears stunning&nbsp;colours during different times of the year. The lake looks white during winter, half snow-covered and half green during spring and summer, and lush green during monsoon and post-monsoon. This is something worth observing if you have the oppurtuinty to trek multiple times to this lake. </p><p>Apart from the scenic beauty, the Serolsar lake has religious significance as well. It is a pilgrimage place for the locals. Locals from the surrounding villages come here every saturday to do the parikrama. They mostly&nbsp;offer ghee and oil to the local diety. It is believed the goddess is submerged in the lake and protects the entire region.</p><p>Serolsar Lake trek is a paradise for someone who loves forest trails. The entire trail is through the dense pine and deodar forests. You also encounter clearings after every hour of the trek which makes them nice resting spots for trekkers to rejoice. From the 360-degree Viewpoint, you get great views of Pir Panjal and the Great Himalayan range. </p><p>Serolsar Lake trek is an easy trek. It can be done by both fit beginners and experienced trekkers. It’s a series of gradual ascents and descents until you reach the lake. The only steep ascent you encounter on this trail is the one that takes you to the 360-degree Viewpoint.</p>`,

  description:`<p class="p-text-1 mt-3 mb-2"><strong>The Unforgettable View of Four of the World's Tallest Mountains</strong></p><div class="TrekOverView_intro_desktop__KbAy2 p-text-4 mt-4"><p>There is nothing else like the Sandakphu Phalut Trek. It offers the breathtaking experience of seeing four of the world's tallest peaks. Yet it is also a trek where nature and culture come together. </p><p>From Phalut, on your left is the Everest cluster, which includes the world's fourth- and fifth-highest mountains, Lhotse and Makalu. It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see these three majestic peaks together from a vantage point. </p><p>The "Sleeping Buddha" on your right is even more impressive. The resemblance of the massif to a sleeping human form is uncanny. The third-highest mountain in the world, Kanchenjunga, stands out as the most prominent peak in this uniquely shaped massif. </p><p>You awaken to the Sleeping Buddha from our Sabalgram campsite. The view often leaves trekkers teary-eyed. </p><p>Sandakphu-Phalut is our favourite spot in the world to view sunrises and sunsets. We have never witnessed a sunset as stunning as the one we see from Aahl. In a quirk of natural wonder, in the evening, a sea of clouds settles below Aahl. The clouds come in like waves on the sea. In this magical cauldron of clouds, the sun slowly descends. Around us, still glistening orange, are the Everest cluster and the Sleeping Buddha. These are some of the trek's most emotional moments. </p><p>Frankly, we want you to do this trek just to see the sunrises and sunsets. In our experience, we have not found any of our treks that give such spectacular sunrises and sunsets. </p><p>The Singalila National Park is, of course, a favourite among our trekkers. The bamboo and rhododendron forests there are among the densest. These forests are magnificent. </p><p>Above Samanden, there is a long section of bamboo. Walking under the canopy of bamboo trees is an experience like no other. The towering stalks of bamboo rise high above, creating a natural ceiling that filters sunlight into a soft green glow. The bamboo stalks are thick and clustered, creating the feeling of being in a secret, magical world. </p><p>In the spring, when rhododendrons bloom, Sandakphu is one of our Indiahikers' top three rhododendron treks. The showy blooms of pink, red, scarlet, and white flowers swathe the mountainside, creating a truly magical moment. </p><p>Our trek leaders have spotted the red panda in these forests once or twice. It is rare, but not totally out of the question, to spot the Himalayan black bear, red panda, and clouded leopard on this trek. The trek’s Indo-Nepali culture is also something we look forward to! On the trek, our path gets in and out of Nepal all the time. Our sleeping tents are in India at some of our camps, and our kitchen tents are in Nepal! </p><p>Our trek leaders don’t want to leave this place! They love this cultural mix. The local families who run the tea houses are known for their warmth and friendliness. When you walk into one of the tea houses, you are greeted with a warm cup of tea and a friendly smile! The Buddhist culture is ever-prevailing. </p><p>The cuisine is a fusion of Nepali and Tibetan. Bhukiya roti is a fantastic, flavourful bread that we adore. The homemade fruit jams go superbly well with it. On the other hand, we love the Nepali Thukpa! It is very different from the thukpa that we get in our cities. Don’t forget to take the Dalle Khursani, one of the world’s spiciest chillies, back home. The bamboo shoot pickles and Churpi (yak cheese) complete your list of souvenirs. </p><p>The Sandakphu-Phalut trek is a spiritual journey towards the Sleeping Buddha. But what comes with it is a chance to observe a rare culture, a bamboo and rhododendron forest like no other, and sunrises and sunsets no one has ever seen.</p></div><div class="TrekOverView_intro_mobile__WtqhU p-text-4">There is nothing else like the Sandakphu Phalut Trek.
